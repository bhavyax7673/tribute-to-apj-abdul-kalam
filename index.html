        <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
        <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, widely known as the "Missile Man of India," was a renowned Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India, serving from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from humble beginnings but rose to become one of the country's most respected leaders. Kalam played a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile development, notably contributing to the success of the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. As a key figure in the development of India's ballistic missile and satellite launch vehicle technology, he was instrumental in advancing the nation’s defense capabilities. His dedication to education and youth empowerment earned him immense respect, particularly for his belief in the power of dreams and hard work. After his presidency, Kalam continued to inspire millions through his speeches, books, and mentorship, focusing on igniting the minds of young Indians. He was a firm believer in self-reliance and envisioned India as a developed nation by 2020. A recipient of numerous awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, Kalam remained a symbol of simplicity and humility throughout his life. He passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of vision, innovation, and selfless service to the nation.</p>
